# restful-restaurants

## Info

Building an API to connect the front-end and back-end of a restaurant review site.
This site will allow its users to view a list of saved restaurants, add to that list, star their favorite restaurants, and leave comments about these places.
I added the remaining routes needed to handle starred restaurants and comments.
